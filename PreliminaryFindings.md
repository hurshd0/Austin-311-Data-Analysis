### Background

In 2001, the City of Austin began using 311 service for Police non-emergency calls. This helped reduce the number of calls to 911, which later got expanded to include more city services.

Now its the single most point of contact for Citywide Services and Information hub. Since then Austinites have reported from port holes, to lost dog, traffic light issues, annoying neighbors, etcâ€¦ The data set is rich in amount of information it carries, it has incident date time, department that belongs to, status update, and geolocation. With such details, the data gets refreshed every half-hour.


### :mag: Preliminary Findings

#### - City is plagued with animal problems, ranging from dead animals to loose dog, making Animal Services and Austin Resource recovery them the busiest department.

Austin isn't the only city that is facing this mess, currently all metropolitan cities are facing this issue, with `Dockless Bike/Scotter` sharing the new vogue, it has literally exploded this recent past few years, with cities dealing with mess in cities like Dallas:

And signs prohibiting scooters on UT Austin's side walks, on Capitol Grounds, and city encouraging the reports of dockless rental scotters being used on trails where it's not allowed.
